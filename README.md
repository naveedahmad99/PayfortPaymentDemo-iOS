# FORT iOS SDK\
\
# Intro\
\
The FORT Mobile SDK allows Merchants to securely integrate the payment functions. It also allows Merchants to easily accept In-App payments. Instead of the traditional, time-consuming, and complex way of being redirected to the mobile browser to complete the payment, In-App payments can be completed through our FORT Mobile SDK. In turn, this gives the Merchant\'92s consumers a smooth, pleasing user-experience by using In-App payment functions through the native applications.\
