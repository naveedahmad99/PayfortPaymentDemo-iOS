# Introduction
The FORT Mobile SDK allows Merchants to securely integrate the payment functions. It also allows Merchants to easily accept In-App payments. Instead of the traditional, time-consuming, and complex way of being redirected to the mobile browser to complete the payment, In-App payments can be completed through our FORT Mobile SDK. In turn, this gives the Merchant\'92s consumers a smooth, pleasing user-experience by using In-App payment functions through the native applications.

# Usage Guide
Please add your actual values of merhant details to Configurations.swift 

    static var requestPhrase = "xxxxxxxx"
    static var accessCode = "xxxxxxxx"
    static var merchantID = "xxxxxxxx"
    
    static let payfortDevPhrase = "xxxxxxxx"
    static let payfortDevAccessCode = "xxxxxxxx"
    static let payfortDevMerchantID = "xxxxxxxx"
    
    static let payfortProductPhrase = "xxxxxxxx"
    static let payfortProductAccessCode = "xxxxxxxx"
    static let payfortProductMerchantID = "xxxxxxxx"
